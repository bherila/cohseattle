ChangeLog for SCForm - Simple Contact Form


rel-1.2.7	20120420

    Removed deprecated session_register() call in scform.php.  (Sorry,
    Kurt, for letting this languish for so long.)

    Wrapped a session variable setting test in isset() in scform.php to
    eliminate warning.  (Harmless, but not good.)

rel-1.2.6	20100106

    Added $noSimilarChars config variable (default: true).  Eliminates
    visually-similar characters from CAPTCHA string.

    *Really* changed use of $HTTP_SESSION_VARS in scform.php to $_SESSION.

    Updated README to indicate new development platform.

rel-1.2.5	20070304

    Some misguided firewalls and HTTP proxy servers delete the HTTP
    REFERER, so...

	Changed default for $chkFormRefNotBlank to false and added cautionary
	note to the docs.

	Added $formProcBlankRefOkay to allow for empty HTTP REFERER in
	scformproc.php, set it to true, and added cautionary note to
	formProcAllowedReferers.

    Updated README.

    Thanks and a tip o' the hat to "Ben" for the suggestions!

    Changed $requireVerify (CAPTCHA) default to false for maximum portability

    Changed the names of a couple of variables in scfconfig.php to make clear
    which were used by the form processor (scformproc.php) and which by the
    form (scform.php).

    Added "Reset" button for form.

    Changed use of $HTTP_SESSION_VARS in scform.php to $_SESSION for
    compatibility with PHP5.  Thanks and a tip o' the hat to
    vigneron over at remcomp-dot-fr for the heads up.

    Upgrading from earlier versions

	You will have to replace scfconfig.php, as well as scform.php and
	scformproc.php.

rel-1.2.4	20060922

    Added support for simple CAPTCHA (tm) form verification to try to foil
    web form spambots.  (See: http://www.captcha.net/)

	Note: Use of this option requires GD graphic library
	support be built in to your web server in order to
	generate the graphic test/verification string.

    Added code to optionally sanity-check HTTP_REFERER as an anti-spam
    measure.  (Thanks and a tip o' the hat to "McWebber" for the idea!)

    Added a bit of conditional code to the response page URL generator to
    prevent double-slashes in the URL. (Thanks and a tip o' the hat to
    Robert Dalton for the bug report.)

    Noted in README that the config files are best placed entirely outside
    the HTTP server document root.  (Thanks and a tip o' the hat to Robert
    Dalton for the suggestion.)

    Upgrading from earlier versions

	You will have to replace scfconfig.php, scform.php and scformproc.php.

	You will have to add scfgenimg.php

rel-1.2.3	20041108

    Added $requireEmail option.

	. If set to "true," user must supply email address (as with
	  all previous versions of SCForm)
	. If set to "false," user is not required to supply an email
	  address.

	Supplied email address is sanity-checked whether $requireEmail is
	set to "true" or "false."

	This change requires an update to scfconfig.php ONLY if you wish
	to set $requireEmail to "false."  Otherwise, it defaults to "true"
	- retaining config file compatibility with v1.2.2 and before.

    Changed META charset to iso8859-1 in scform.php and scfresp.php so all
    Western characters will render.  (Thanks and a tip o' the hat to
    Claude Flener for the suggestion.)

rel-1.2.2	20041010

    Added additional processing to submitted "Subject" field text to make
    sure the field can't be stuffed with a line-break, followed by "Cc:"
    or "Bcc:" headers.

	Note: I don't believe a vulnerability existed.  Past
	experiments in trying to exploit SCForm like this, even
	by doing the stuffing in the code, were not successful.
	This change is insurance.

rel-1.2.1	20040929

    Added code to detect running on MS-Windows hosts and automatically

	. Trim trailing newline from last added header line
	. Transform newlines into carriage-return/newline pairs

    It turns out that (some?) MS-Windows-based MTAs want carriage-returns
    and won't tolerate "trailing" carriage-return/newline pairs.

    Added note about trailing blank lines in scfconfig.php.  Thanks and a
    tip o' the hat to Judy for the help!

rel-1.2.0	20040712

    1.1.3 promoted to "production" status.

rel-1.1.3	20040623

    Fixed bug in banlist checking that would cause banlist entries in CIDR
    notation (e.g.: 10.1.2.0/24) to sometimes do the wrong thing--either
    failing to catch things in the listed netblock or perhaps catching
    things that weren't.

rel-1.1.2	20040410

    Fixed coding error in scformproc.php that prevented dotted-quad
    (nn.nn.nn.nn) banlist entries from working.

    Sample form (scform.php) now includes scfconfig.php, rather than
    specifying things like the contacts.cfg file locally.

    Added "X-SCForm-Referer:" header in emailed output.  (Shows how
    sender got to the form if it was from another page.)

	Note: This will require updating scfconfig.php *if* you
	want this new X-header.

    Fixed minor documentation bug in README.  Added short "Updating"
    section.

    Updated copyright notices.  Fixed URL for SCForm's home page in
    docs.

rel-1.1.1	20030206

    Changed behaviour of $allowedReferers configuration array.  Now, if
    it's empty, scformproc.php will accept from any referer.  This was
    necessary as it seems some web servers don't set the HTTP_REFERER
    environment variable.  Note that this means SCForm now works the way
    the documentation always said it did.

    Added "Hints, Kinks and Tricks" section to README, starting off with
    "Figuring Out What To Put In $allowedReferers"

rel-1.1.0	20021215

    This release consists of documentation changes only.

    Added installation step that talks about possible directory
    browsing danger that would compromise the secrecy of "contacts"
    list and .htaccess file suggestions.  Thanks to Scott Vickrey
    for the suggestion.

    Added note about local mail server software being required.

rel-1.0.0	20021211

    It's been over a week since 0.1.4 was released.  There've been
    140 unique downloads of SCForm-0.1.0 thru 0.1.4, with over 115
    unique downloads (calculated) of 0.1.4 alone.  There has been no
    negative feedback and one very positive review on
    php.resourceindex.com.  The script's been in use on at least
    three (3) production servers I know of personally with no
    reported problems.

    I guess it's ready ;).

rel-0.1.4	20021202

    Changed scformproc.php to to re-direct to new page on successful
    submit.  This prevents problem of user hitting refresh/reload on
    browser re-submitting form contents.  This change adds scfresp.php
    to the distribution.

rel-0.1.3	20021130

    Check for IP address of proxied clients (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR).
    Thanks to Ian H. for the suggestion in comp.lang.php and the
    collaboration.

    Added section "Remote Host and Address Tracking" to README.

    The files in .zip versions of the distribution now have
    carriage-returns in them for the convenience of our MS-Windows-
    using brethren.

rel-0.1.2	20021130

    Improved sender email address matching.
    Expanded installation docs in README.

rel-0.1.1	20021129

    Added ability to specify banned addresses in /nn CIDR notation.
    Thanks to Joe Jared for the suggestion and example (Perl) code.

rel-0.1.0	20021129

    Initial release.
